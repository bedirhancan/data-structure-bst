# Data Structures Binary Search Tree - Linked Lists

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Data Structures course at Sakarya University (Fall 2024-2025).  
The project focuses on creating linked lists and binary search trees and building an interactive system for user operations.

## Features
- Binary search trees were created from each line in the `agaclar.txt` file.
- Trees were connected using a singly linked list.
- Users can navigate the list with **A** and **D** keys to view the selected tree.
- **S** key allows users to delete the selected node or tree.
- **W** key mirrors the selected tree.
- Each tree's total value is calculated using ASCII values and visually displayed.

## Learnings
- Establishing relationships between linked lists and binary trees.
- Using ASCII values for data comparisons.
- Developing systems that respond dynamically to user inputs.

## Challenges
- Tree visualization was not as desired but achieved a readable structure.
- Spacing between trees in the list could not be perfectly formatted but produced near-desired results.

## Setup
1. Download the project from [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bedirhancan/data-structure-bst).
2. Open the project in a C++ IDE.
3. Place the `agaclar.txt` file in the project folder.
4. Compile and run the program to perform operations.

## Usage
1. Upon running the program, linked lists and binary search trees are created.
2. Navigate the linked list using the **A** or **D** keys.
3. Use **S** to delete a node or tree, and **W** to mirror the selected tree.
